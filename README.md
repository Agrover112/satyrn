# Satyrn
Satyrn is a command-line-based alternative to Jupyter notebooks.
The backend is completely based on node networks, because I soon 
plan to implement branching code graphs in order to provide the user
with visual differentiation while writing code, and perhaps even 
worry-free backend multithreading.
